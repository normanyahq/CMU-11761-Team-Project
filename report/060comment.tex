This assignment lead us to the real word of language modeling! We started from extracting features, exploring practical modeling techniques and finally built a pretty successful classification model. For feature extraction part, we found that heuristic works better than our thought. Some simple features such as the repetition of phrases can lead to more than 80\% accuracy by only using this very feature. We also found that the performance of language modeling is better than our thought. By using a combination of 3 to 5 features, we can easily get an accuracy of over 80\%. So language technologies do have a great application! However, we found that once achieved a nearly 90\% accuracy, the improvement become really difficult. Only by adding reasonable features won?t help, it might even lead to overfitting if you?re not training on a massive corpus. Some strong features or more powerful models should be used instead if you want to improve the performance one step away. So language do require a lot of future research. \\\\
Also, we used the 100M corpus as additional data set and this do help us increase the accuracy from 80\% to 89\%. That?s a huge improvement! So aside from good features, the size of training data matters a lot since it matter a lot in the model training process.
