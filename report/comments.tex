This assignment gives us a chance to apply statistical method on classification problem, which is good practice 
for real problems that we will meet in the future. We analyzed the task together, and discussed what features
are reasonable, what models are best for this 2-class classification problem, and how we could develop the 
program together. 

We not only get a sense of how the language models work, but also learned techniques in
team management\footnote{We used team management tool Teambition to share files and manage tasks} 
and software engineering\footnote{We used Git for version control and Tmux to extract data and train model
remotely on server clusters, and parallelize our programs to accelerate the calculation}.

One thing that worth mentioning is that, for the 4-gram perplexity feature, which has the best performance among
all of ours, was almost
