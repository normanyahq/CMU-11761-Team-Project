In this project, we tackled the problem to distinguish real and fake documents, where the fake documents are generated based on a trigram model. we experimented three types of features, semantic feature, syntactic feature and statistical feature. We also built four classifiers, KNN, logistic regression, SVM and gradient boosting. In our experiment, we found that the statistical features is very useful when the statistics are estimated by MLE from large corpus, while has little use when the statistics is from small dataset. The semantic feature is also very useful even within small dataset. The syntactic features has less use in our experiment due to the lack of grammatical structure in spoken language. For classifiers, gradient boosting outperforms the other classifiers, since it is able to adapt different features we extracted to different documents.
